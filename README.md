## Overview

This project is a web application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** that displays **responsive product cards**. Each card showcases product details such as the product name, image, description. The layout is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes to provide an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The product cards adjust dynamically based on the screen size, ensuring they look great on all devices.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The application uses Tailwind CSS for quick and efficient styling with utility-first classes.
- **TypeScript**: Built with TypeScript to ensure type safety across components and provide better development experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for rendering the product cards dynamically.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for better development workflow.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build custom designs directly in your markup.
